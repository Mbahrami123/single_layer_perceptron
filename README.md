# single_layer_perceptron

This is an implementation of single layer perceptron algorithm in Python.

## About Perceptron

A perceptron is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification which inputs a vector of numbers, applies weights to the inputs and uses an activation function to generate the result.

It was later developed into multi layer perceptrons or artificial neural networks

It is a simplified model of a biological neuron.
